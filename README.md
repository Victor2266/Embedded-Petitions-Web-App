# Embedded-Petitions-Web-App
This is a web app using Google App Script's platform that counts the number of entries in a google spreadsheet to display the progress of a petition.


<p>Originally developed because SquareSpace lacked an add-on for hosting petitions like change.org</p>


<p>The spreadsheet could be populated by anything. And the app can be embedded on any website not limited to Squarespace.</p>


<p>An example use case is using a SquareSpace form to collect signatures and embedding the web app as a petition progress tracker.</p>

It works with SquareSpace's built in form:
