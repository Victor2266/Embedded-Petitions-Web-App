# Embedded-Petitions-Web-App
This is a web app using Google App Script's platform that counts the number of entries in a google spreadsheet and displays the progress of a petition.
Orginally developed because SquareSpace lacked an add on for hosting petitions like change.org
The spreadsheet could be populated by anything.
An example usecase is using a SquareSpace form to collect signatures and embedding the webapp as a petition progress tracker.

It works with SquareSpace's built in form:
